# Introduction
If you ever get stuck, you can find us over on the [SNDEVS](https://sndevs.com) slack ([invite.sndevs.com](https://invite.sndevs.com)) in either the #hactoberfest channel or the #next-experience-uib-workspace channel. 

Things you'll need:
- A [ServiceNow Developer Instance](https://developer.servicenow.com/)
# Contributing guidelines
- If you want to contribute changes to the Custom Component itself, be sure to go to the [sister repository](https://github.com/ServiceNowDevProgram/Menu-Generating-Operations-Program-Widget-Custom-Component) and work from there. 
- Be sure to follow the installation instructions below so your page isn't empty. 
- Do not make changes to the default page in this experience. Make sure you create a Variant and only make changes there. Don't make changes to other people's variants.
