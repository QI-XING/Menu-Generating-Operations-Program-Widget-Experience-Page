# Contributing guidelines
- If you want to contribute changes to the Custom Component itself, be sure to go to the [sister repository](https://github.com/ServiceNowDevProgram/Menu-Generating-Operations-Program-Widget-Custom-Component) and work from there. 
- Be sure to follow the installation instructions below so your page isn't empty. 
- Do not make changes to the default page in this experience. Make sure you create a Variant and only make changes there. Don't make changes to other people's variants. 
- Pull request descriptions must be explicit and descriptive of what is being changed.  
- Changes that are not within the scope of the description will result in the entire PR being rejected.
- Low-effort/spam Pull Requests will be marked as spam accordingly.
